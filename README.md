## Abstract

This was a one week 'Jeopardy!' project for Mod2 at Turing School of Software & Design. First, we mapped out our OOP diagram and a few wireframes. We implemented array iterator and mutator methods to work with game data. We wrote modular, reusable code that follows SRP (Single Responibility Principle). The game has three rounds, three players, and the clues change at random per each round. We created a test suite that thoroughly tests some functionality of a client-side application. While being held to strict deadlines, our project is not completely finished - please see issues for work that still needs to be done.
