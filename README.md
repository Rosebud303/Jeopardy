## Abstract

This was a one week 'Jeopardy!' project for Mod2 at Turing School of Software & Design. First, we mapped out our OOP diagram and a few wireframes. We implemented array iterator and mutator methods to work with game data. We wrote modular, reusable code that follows SRP (Single Responibility Principle). The game has three rounds, three players, and the clues change at random per each round. We created a test suite that thoroughly tests some functionality of a client-side application. While being held to strict deadlines, our project is not completely finished - please see issues for work that still needs to be done.

## Setup

After one person has forked the repo, everyone should clone down the forked repo. Since you don't want to name your project "gametime-starter", you can use an optional argument when you run `git clone` (you replace the `[...]` with the terminal command arguments):

```bash
git clone [remote-address] [what you want to name the repo]
```

Once you have cloned the repo, install the library dependencies. Run:

```bash
npm install
```
To run tests in the game program, Run:
```bash
npm test
```
